Build an online bank account transaction viewer using HTML
Problem Statement
You are asked to build a simple web application for an online bank. Your task is to create an interface that allows users to view their account transactions.



Your application must meet the following requirements:



1. Create a dropdown that allows users to select the type of transaction they want to view using basic HTML tags.

    1.1. The application supports the transactions "All", "DEPOSIT" and "WITHDRAWL".

    1.2. When the user clicks on Search it should display a list area below the dropdown where the transactions will be shown.

    1.3. When the page is loaded initially it should display all transactions.



2. Use inline CSS to style the interface:Set a background color for the body.

    2.1. Change the color of the transaction list items based on their type i.e. green for deposits and red for withdrawals.

    2.2. Style links (if any) to have a custom color when hovered over.



3. Populate an initial list of transactions (4 transactions are hardcoded for you. Use them. Do not change those transactions or do not add/delete new transactions).

    3.1. When the user selects a type from the dropdown, filter the transaction list to show only the selected type of transactions.

    3.2. Display each transaction in the list area below the dropdown.
